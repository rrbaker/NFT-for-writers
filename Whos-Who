# Who's Who

## Introduce yourself!

Please use this space to share your name, social profiles, website, market pages, and most of all an introduction of who you are, what brings you to this space, what moves you about you art, and anything else you want to get to know you.

### How to add your name

If you know have a github account, you probably don't need the direction. Feel free to fork and submit a pull request.

If you don't and/or are non-technical -- and most are not -- that is okay! DM me your details: I'm @rrbaker on all the things and I'll get you added to the list.
