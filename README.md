# NFT Guide for Writers

This repository is meant to be a space to collect and share guidance, tools, and examples for writers of all types, from poets and playwrights to novelists and bloggers. This space is wonderful for artists but I believe writers are struggling to see how we can bring writen and spoken works in meaningful ways, so let's help each other out!

I'll be adding to this as I find more tools and talents in this space. In the meantime, we have a #writers-lab channel on the [NFTs.tips discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/6mnTWReX3t). Please join us there to share what you're working on and ideas on how to grow this resource!
